# JuliaDemoForDESC

In order to serve in the usual mode (no interactivity), just run on the shell,

```
jupyter nbconvert *.ipynb --to slides --post serve
```

For interactivity, you can install the RISE extension. Then there will be a button when you run the Jupyter notebook, on the toolbar. The button looks like a little plot.

```
pip install RISE
jupyter notebook
```
